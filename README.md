These are the supplementary resources of our paper "LLM-powered Multi-agent Framework for Goal-oriented Learning in Intelligent Tutoring System", accepted by WWW 2025 (Industry Track) as an Oral Presentation.

In this paper, we propose GenMentor, a large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent framework designed for goal-oriented learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). This framework emphasizes personalization, adaptive learning, and goal-aligned content delivery, making it a robust solution for professional and lifelong learning scenarios.
