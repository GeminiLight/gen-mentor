> [!IMPORTANT]  
> :sparkles: Welcome to access the [GenMentor website](https://www.tianfuwang.tech/gen-mentor) to learn more about our work!

These are the supplementary resources of our paper "LLM-powered Multi-agent Framework for Goal-oriented Learning in Intelligent Tutoring System", accepted by WWW 2025 (Industry Track) as an Oral Presentation.

In this paper, we propose GenMentor, a large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent framework designed for goal-oriented learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). This framework emphasizes personalization, adaptive learning, and goal-aligned content delivery, making it a robust solution for professional and lifelong learning scenarios.

> [!NOTE]  
> We will release more available resources (code and data) in future updates, which are still under the internal review process of Microsoft. Stay tuned!
